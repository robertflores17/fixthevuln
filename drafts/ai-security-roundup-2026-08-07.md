  arXiv:2608.05199v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Autonomous security agents operate as staged pipelines, such as classifying network traffic and then attributing attacks to a specific technique. Split conformal prediction gives each stage finite-sample coverage, but deployment req

  arXiv:2608.05201v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Autonomous AI agent platforms differ substantially in architecture, security, tool integration, execution, autonomy, and deployment, yet the field lacks a common classification scheme for comparing these design choices. We propose A

  Source: [arXiv cs.CR](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent) — Aug 07
  arXiv:2608.05217v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) increasingly rely on input-adaptive inference, such as token pruning and early halting, to meet energy and latency budgets. This survey examines a recent class of adversarial efficiency degradation attacks

  Source: [arXiv cs.CR](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent) — Aug 07
  arXiv:2608.05430v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The remarkable instruction-following ability of modern LLMs has enabled their practical use as the minds of agents that can autonomously complete increasingly complex tasks. Therein, however, also lies their vulnerability to attacks
