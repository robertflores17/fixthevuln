  Source: [arXiv cs.CR](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent), Oct 23.
  arXiv:2610.30184v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Security bugs often slip past static analysis not because they are impossible to detect, but because detection rules have not yet been written for the code in front of us. New frameworks, APIs, and coding idioms continually create s

- **[Protection Is Not One Event: A Survey of RAG Protection Research by Measured Endpoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.30193)**  
  Source: [arXiv cs.CR](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent), Oct 23.
  arXiv:2610.30193v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation &#40;RAG&#41; systems face security, privacy, and copyright risks including content leakage, source reconstruction, unauthorized access, data poisoning, and prompt injection. Yet RAG protection studies use inc

  arXiv:2610.30202v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: With the rapid integration of Multi-modal Large Language Models &#40;MLLMs&#41; into real-world applications, Prompt Injection &#40;PI&#41; has emerged as a critical security threat. Attackers can conceal malicious instructions within textual narra

- **[PhishGen: Understanding LLM Capabilities in Automated Phishing Website Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.30226)**  
  Source: [arXiv cs.CR](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent), Oct 23.
  arXiv:2610.30226v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Phishing relies on visual deception, traditionally requiring web-development skills or pre-built kits. LLMs erode this barrier by generating functional websites from natural-language prompts, yet prior work does not answer how far L

- **[Mirage: Targeted Jailbreaks Against Post-Generation Safety Checkers in Multimodal Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.30348)**  
  Source: [arXiv cs.CR](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent), Oct 23.
  arXiv:2610.30348v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Post-generation safety checkers are widely employed in diffusion-model pipelines to prevent unsafe generated content from reaching users. In this paper, we show that these safety checkers can still be bypassed by our proposed multim

  arXiv:2610.30365v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Web-searching Large Language Models &#40;LLMs&#41; have changed how users seek online information: instead of sifting through ranked lists of links, users read synthesized answers. This shift creates a new LLM vulnerability: a data-void exp

  Source: [arXiv cs.CR](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent), Oct 23.
  arXiv:2610.30418v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Modern LLM agents can retrieve information from accessible documents, and then disclose a sensitive conclusion assembled from them. This mosaic effect creates a critical risk for agents operating over confidential data. We quantify

  Source: [arXiv cs.CR](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent), Oct 23.
  arXiv:2610.30516v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In large language model &#40;LLM&#41; steganography, an encoder hides a private message in an otherwise ordinary response, as text transmitted to a decoder, who attempts to recover it. The success of this private-message transmission is com

  Source: [arXiv cs.CR](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent), Oct 23.
  arXiv:2610.30576v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A fundamental paradox plagues the deployment of Machine Learning in cybersecurity: supervised models generalize poorly to novel, Out-of-Distribution &#40;OoD&#41; attacks, whereas unsupervised models often suffer from poor separability, lea

  arXiv:2610.30626v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The increasing release and reuse of Large Language Models &#40;LLMs&#41; as open-weight checkpoints make model fingerprinting important for ownership protection and offline auditing. Existing fingerprinting methods typically construct evide

  Source: [arXiv cs.CR](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent), Oct 23.
  arXiv:2610.30666v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: LLM-based scam systems increasingly combine adaptive dialogue, persistent context, external tools, and multi-agent coordination to automate personalized fraud. These capabilities also create a resource dependency: every reasoning st
