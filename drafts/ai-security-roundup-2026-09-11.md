  Source: [arXiv cs.CR](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent) — Sep 11
  arXiv:2609.10892v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: When an indirect prompt injection succeeds against an LLM agent, the compromise is visible in the agent's own behavior: a benign prefix of tool calls, a poisoned observation, and a suffix of actions that serve the attacker. An opera
