  arXiv:2609.19226v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: AI-mediated platforms coordinate work through LLM agents acting for different principals. In these workflows, privacy loss can be created before a final answer appears: a memory write, shared-workspace update, inter-agent message, o

  Source: [arXiv cs.CR](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent) — Sep 18
  arXiv:2609.20069v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) protocols guarantee safety and liveness despite the malicious failure of nodes. However, they do not prevent adversarial manipulation of transaction order, where the order a proposer assigns diverges f

  Source: [arXiv cs.CR](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CR/recent) — Sep 18
  arXiv:2609.20211v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Safety monitors in LLM agent systems often judge actions from summaries or stored handoffs, not from the original evidence. This creates a simple but dangerous failure mode: the handoff preserves the claim that an action is authoriz

  arXiv:2609.20370v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In pay-per-token LLM services, the more a model says, the more users pay. Dishonest providers can covertly manipulate generation to inflate output tokens while largely preserving task utility. We define such manipulation as a Provid

  Source: [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) — Sep 14
  The cost of writing code collapsed, and the cost of reviewing, fixing and operating it is following, and I'm assuming it gets there. What's left of making software is finding out what people actually want, defining it precisely, and making it pleasant to use. That cost is per pie
