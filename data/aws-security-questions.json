        "B. AWS Security Hub",
        "C. Amazon Inspector",
        "D. AWS Config"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity by analyzing VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail management and data event logs, and DNS logs. It uses machine learning and threat intelligence to identify unexpected and potentially unauthorized activity.",

      "question": "A security engineer notices a GuardDuty finding of type UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration.OutsideAWS. What does this finding indicate?",
      "options": [
        "A. An IAM user's console password has been compromised",
        "B. EC2 instance credentials are being used from an external IP address outside of AWS",
        "C. An S3 bucket policy allows public access",
        "D. A Lambda function is invoking APIs from an unauthorized VPC"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "This GuardDuty finding indicates that EC2 instance role credentials created on an instance are being used from an IP address outside of AWS. This typically means the credentials have been exfiltrated and are being used by an external threat actor.",

      "domain": 1,
      "objective": "1.2",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "question": "During an incident response, a security engineer needs to isolate a compromised EC2 instance while preserving evidence. What is the BEST approach?",
      "options": [
        "A. Terminate the instance immediately and review CloudTrail logs",
        "B. Change the instance's security group to one that denies all inbound and outbound traffic, and create an EBS snapshot",
        "C. Stop the instance and delete the attached IAM role",
        "D. Detach the instance from the VPC and reboot it"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Replacing the security group with one that blocks all traffic isolates the instance from the network while keeping it running for forensic analysis. Creating an EBS snapshot preserves the disk state as evidence. Terminating or stopping would destroy volatile memory evidence.",

        "A. Use a GuardDuty finding published to EventBridge to trigger a Lambda function that modifies the instance security group",
        "B. Configure GuardDuty to automatically quarantine the instance using built-in remediation",
        "C. Use AWS Config auto-remediation to change the security group",
        "D. Create a CloudWatch alarm on the finding and notify the team via SNS"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "GuardDuty findings are published to EventBridge, which can trigger a Lambda function for automated remediation. The Lambda function can immediately replace the instance's security group with a quarantine group. GuardDuty does not have built-in automated remediation capabilities.",

        "B. Disable the compromised access key",
        "C. Rotate all access keys in the account",
        "D. Revoke all active sessions for the account"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The first step is to disable (deactivate) the compromised access key to prevent further unauthorized use. Deleting the user or rotating all keys is excessive as an initial response, and revoking sessions does not address key-based API calls.",
      "link": "start-here.html"
    },

      "objective": "1.1",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "question": "A security team discovers that GuardDuty is generating findings for expected traffic from a third-party penetration testing vendor. How should they suppress these findings without disabling GuardDuty?",
      "options": [
        "A. Add the vendor's IP addresses to a GuardDuty trusted IP list",
        "B. Create an EventBridge rule that drops findings from those IPs",
        "C. Modify the VPC Flow Logs to exclude the vendor's traffic",
        "D. Add a suppression rule in GuardDuty based on the vendor's CIDR range"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "GuardDuty trusted IP lists prevent the service from generating findings for traffic originating from those IP addresses. Suppression rules archive findings but still generate them. Trusted IP lists are the correct mechanism for known authorized sources like pen testing vendors.",

      "options": [
        "A. IAM Access Advisor",
        "B. CloudTrail event history and S3-stored trail logs",
        "C. VPC Flow Logs",
        "D. AWS Config resource timeline"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "CloudTrail records all API calls made in the account. The CloudTrail console provides 90 days of management event history, and if a trail is configured to deliver logs to S3, historical data is available for the full retention period. VPC Flow Logs only capture network traffic, not API calls.",

      "options": [
        "A. Create an AMI of the instance and launch a new instance for analysis",
        "B. Use SSM Run Command to execute a memory acquisition tool like LiME on the instance",
        "C. Stop the instance and create an EBS snapshot",
        "D. Enable detailed CloudWatch monitoring and review memory metrics"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Using SSM Run Command to execute a memory acquisition tool like LiME (Linux Memory Extractor) on the running instance captures volatile memory without requiring SSH access. Creating an AMI or stopping the instance would lose volatile memory contents.",

      "options": [
        "A. Delete the IAM role",
        "B. Attach a deny-all inline policy to the role with a condition for tokens issued before the current time",
        "C. Remove all managed policies from the role",
        "D. Disable the role's trust policy"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Attaching an inline deny-all policy with an aws:TokenIssueTime condition that denies access for tokens issued before a specific timestamp effectively revokes all previously issued temporary credentials while allowing newly assumed role sessions to work.",
