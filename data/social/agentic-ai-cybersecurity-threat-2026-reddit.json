Learn how autonomous AI agents create new attack vectors and how these threats map directly to Security+ SY0-701 exam domains..\n\nThe part that stood out most to me is how this maps to real-world security operations — it's not just theoretical. If you're running a SOC or managing vulnerability programs, this directly affects your threat model.\n\nKey points:\n- How this changes the threat landscape for defenders\n- Practical mitigations you can implement now\n- Which frameworks/controls address this (mapped to Security+ domains for those studying)\n\nI wrote up a detailed analysis here if you want the full breakdown: https://fixthevuln.com/blog/agentic-ai-cybersecurity-threat-2026.html\n\nWhat's your team doing to address this? Curious to hear how others are handling it.",
