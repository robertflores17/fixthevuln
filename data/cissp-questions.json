      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A security policy communicates management's expectations and direction for how the organization will protect its assets. Technical configurations are found in standards and baselines, vulnerability lists come from assessments, and step-by-step instructions are procedures.",

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Deterrent controls are designed to discourage potential attackers. Examples include warning banners, security cameras, and security guards.

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The primary limitation of qualitative risk assessment is that it uses subjective ratings (high/medium/low) rather than precise monetary values, making cost-benefit analysis of security controls less precise. Quantitative analysis, while more resource-intensive, provides specific financial figures for decision-making.",
