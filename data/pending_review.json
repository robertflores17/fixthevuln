      "description": "SmarterTools SmarterMail contains an authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel vulnerability in the password reset API. The force-reset-password endpoint permits anonymous requests and fails to verify the existing password or a reset token when resetting system administrator accounts. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to supply a target administrator username and a new password to reset the account, resulting in full administrative compromise of the SmarterMail instance.",
