        "Delay notification until the investigation is fully complete in all jurisdictions",

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The best approach is to work with legal counsel to develop jurisdiction-specific notification plans that comply with each region's requirements. A blanket approach may miss specific requirements, while delaying may violate mandatory notification timelines in some jurisdictions.",

      "explanation": "The primary purpose of isolating a compromised system is to prevent the threat from spreading laterally to other systems and causing further damage. While isolation also supports evidence preservation, containment of the threat is the immediate priority.",

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The most important element is clearly defined communication channels, responsibilities, and SLAs for coordinating incident response with the cloud provider.
